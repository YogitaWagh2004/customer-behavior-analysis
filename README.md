# customer-behavior-analysis

## Businesses Problem Statement

  Businesses collect large volumes of transactional data, but without proper cleaning, transformation and visualization. It's difficult to understand customer behavior, sales trends and product performance.
  The Goal of this project was to convert raw shopping data into meaningful insights that can support data-driven decisions.

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The objective is to load and clean a dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), run SQL queries using MySQL, and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to generate business insights.

The project highlights practical data analytics skills commonly used in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset

- Format: CSV

- Description: The dataset contains structured data used to analyze trends, patterns, and key metrics relevant to the problem domain.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- SQL: MySQL for querying and analysis

- Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation

- Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and documentation

## Project Workflow / Steps

- Data Loading

  Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  Checked data structure, missing values, and distributions.

  Identified trends, outliers, and correlations.

- Data Cleaning

  Handled missing values and duplicates.

  Corrected data types and standardized formats.

- SQL Analysis (MySQL)

  Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.

  Wrote SQL queries to answer analytical questions and extract insights.

- Dashboard Development

  Connected Power BI to MySQL / cleaned dataset.

  Built interactive visualizations

## Power BI Dashboard

  - The Power BI dashboard provides:

  -  Key performance indicators (KPIs)

  - Trend analysis and comparisons

  - Interactive filters for deeper exploration

## Results & Insights

  Identified key trends and patterns in the data.

  Highlighted important metrics relevant to decision-making.

  Demonstrated how Python, SQL, and BI tools work together in a real analytics pipeline.

## Future Improvements

  Automate data updates using scheduled pipelines.

  Add advanced analytics or predictive modeling.

  Enhance dashboard interactivity and performance.
